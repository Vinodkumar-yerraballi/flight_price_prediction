In the dataset is taken from the kaggle website, we do some data cleaning process and some data visualization, In the prepocessing  remove the some unnessary columns and do clean the data,afte the data cleaning we convert the categorical data to numerical using the label encoder after that we divided the data training and testing,then bulid the machine learning model. Then we use Regression algorithm because this is Regression problem,we get 89% accuracy score for the Decisiontreeregressor,Randomforestregressor after that hyperparametr turning using the gridsearchcv method. after that we deploy the model using the streamlit.
